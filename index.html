            <p>
                Kurtrina Cuene otherwise known as Kurt! Resides in a 7 bedroom house off of Como Ave in Minneapolis Minnesota. She has lived there for the past 6 months with her 8 roomates. (7 humans and 1 cat) Kurt is Anna Cuenes cat but loved by all the roomies, she's not the only cat in the house but she takes ownership and free reign. Snyxx a cute gray cat, who lives mainly in Olivias room on the second floor, and we'll see her occasionally wander downstairs if we are all there hangin out. She's gotta watch out though, Kurt likes to be queen of the living room. 
            
                The only place Kurt can't go is the basement, shes got a bad habit of eating things that are harmful, her favorite being plastic. The basement is full of nooks and crannies that could contain bits and peices Kurt would be interested in. Luckily she happily runs around the other three floors getting into trouble. If she's not napping, Kurt gets lonely, and will meow as loud as she can until someone answers. Usually she then comes running to be pet.
